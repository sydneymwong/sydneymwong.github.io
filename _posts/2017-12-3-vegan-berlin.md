title: "Vegan in Berlin"
date: 2017-12-03
---

I have recently returned from a 2-week trip to Berlin and Munich.  It was my first time traveling internationally since becoming vegan, and so I did a bit of research before going.  In fact, I chose to travel to Berlin because I Google-searched “Best Places to be a Vegan Tourist” and found many lists in which Berlin ranked highly.  I wanted to write this blog post to show others how easy is to be vegan in Berlin and Munich (the Munich info will be in another post) and to suggest some really great vegan restaurants!

I have personally visited each place described below and taken all the pictures myself.  The map at the end contains additional restaurants that I did not go to but read about as having vegan options.

### Beer
The Reinheitsgebot, or “German Beer Purity Law”, is a Bavarian law from 1516 that states the only ingredients that could be used in the production of beer were water, barley, and hops.  Since 1516, there is a revised law (“Provisional Beer Law”) of 1993, which states that only water, malted barley, hops and yeast can be used for any bottom-fermented beer brewed in Germany.  This is good news for vegans, because it means German beers are vegan.

### Allergens
All the menus have letters or numbers with a legend indicating possible allergens.  These include egg and dairy but also soy, wheat, nuts, seafood, etc.

## Activism
I'm sure there are many opportunities to be involved in vegan activism.  I did not actively seek these opportunities out.  However, one night at Alexanderplatz I did meet a group of vegans who had a table set up and were giving out flyers.  I stopped and talked to them and they said they were trying to end hunting, which is popular in Germany.
