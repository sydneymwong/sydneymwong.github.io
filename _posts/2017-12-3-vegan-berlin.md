title: "Vegan in Berlin"
date: 2017-12-03

I have recently returned from a 2-week trip to Berlin and Munich.  It was my first time traveling internationally since becoming vegan, and so I did a bit of research before going.  In fact, I chose to travel to Berlin because I Google-searched “Best Places to be a Vegan Tourist” and found many lists in which Berlin ranked highly.  I wanted to write this blog post to show others how easy is to be vegan in Berlin and Munich (the Munich info will be in another post) and to suggest some really great vegan restaurants!

I have personally visited each place described below and taken all the pictures myself.  The map at the end contains additional restaurants that I did not go to but read about as having vegan options.

## Grocery Stores

### Veganz - Vegan, 3 locations in Berlin:

### Beer
The Reinheitsgebot, or “German Beer Purity Law”, is a Bavarian law from 1516 that states the only ingredients that could be used in the production of beer were water, barley, and hops.  Since 1516, there is a revised law (“Provisional Beer Law”) of 1993, which states that only water, malted barley, hops and yeast can be used for any bottom-fermented beer brewed in Germany.  This is good news for vegans, because it means German beers are vegan.
