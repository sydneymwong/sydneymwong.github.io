title: "Vegan in Berlin"

I have recently returned from a 2-week trip to Berlin and Munich.  It was my first time traveling internationally since becoming vegan, and so I did a bit of research before going.  In fact, I chose to travel to Berlin because I Google-searched “Best Places to be a Vegan Tourist” and found many lists in which Berlin ranked highly.  I wanted to write this blog post to show others how easy is to be vegan in Berlin and Munich (the Munich info will be in another post) and to suggest some really great vegan restaurants!

I have personally visited each place described below and taken all the pictures myself.  The map at the end contains additional restaurants that I did not go to but read about as having vegan options.

## Restaurants

### Kurfurstendamm

Vaust - (€€) Vegan, Pestalozzistraße 8, 10625.  Transit: Savignyplatz.  Must try their currywurst and home-brewed beer!  Best to make a reservation.

### Mitte

Momos - (€) Vegetarian with vegan options, Chausseestraße 2, 10115.  Transit: Oranienburger Tor.

Kopps - (€€€) Vegan, Linienstraße 94, 10115.  Transit: Rosenthaler Platz.  Pricier but great ambiance and food.  Best to make a reservation.

### Prenzlauer Berg

Chaostheorie - (€) Vegan, Schliemannstraße 15, 10437.  Transit: Prenzlauer Allee, Eberswalder Straße or Schönhauser Allee.  Variety of vegan cakes to buy by the slice.  Cake was good but kind of dry.

Lia’s Kitchen - (€) Vegan, Kollwitzstraße 47, 10405.  Transit: Senefelderplatz.

### Friedrichshain

Curry and Beer - (€) Serves meat but has vegan options, Warschauer Str. 16, 10243.  Transit: Frankfurter Tor.

Papa Nô - (€€) Serves meat but has vegan options, Warschauer Str. 81a, 10243.  Transit: Frankfurter Tor.

Voner - (€) Vegan, Boxhagener Str. 56, 10245.  Transit: Ostkreuz.

Zeus Pizza & Pide - (€) Serves meat but has vegan options, Boxhagener Str. 29-30, 10245.  Transit: Frankfurter Tor.  Ask for their vegan menu.  They have a separate menu that’s all vegan and has a ton of options!  We had the Zeus pizza which had mushrooms, salami, ham, banana peppers, and cheese (9 €).

## Grocery Stores

### Veganz - Vegan, 3 locations in Berlin:

* Schivelbeiner Str. 34, 10439 (Prenzlauer Berg).  Transit: Schönhauser Allee.
* Warschauer Str. 33, 10243 (Friedrichshain).  Transit: Warschauer Straße.
* Marheinekepl. 15, 10961 (Bergmannkiez).  Transit: U-Bhf Gneisenaustraße.

### Beer
The Reinheitsgebot, or “German Beer Purity Law”, is a Bavarian law from 1516 that states the only ingredients that could be used in the production of beer were water, barley, and hops.  Since 1516, there is a revised law (“Provisional Beer Law”) of 1993, which states that only water, malted barley, hops and yeast can be used for any bottom-fermented beer brewed in Germany.  This is good news for vegans, because it means German beers are vegan.

## Shopping (Clothes, Shoes)

DearGoods Berlin - Clothing store that also sells handbags, Schivelbeiner Str. 35, 10439.  Transit: Schönhauser Allee.

Avesu - Shoe store that also sells handbags.  Schivelbeiner Str. 35, 10439.  Transit: Schönhauser Allee.
