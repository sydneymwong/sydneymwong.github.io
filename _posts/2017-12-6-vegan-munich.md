title: "Vegan in Munich"

I have recently returned from a 2-week trip to Berlin and Munich.  It was my first time traveling internationally since becoming vegan, and so I did a bit of research before going.  In fact, I chose to travel to Berlin because I Google-searched “Best Places to be a Vegan Tourist” and found many lists in which Berlin ranked highly.  I wanted to write this blog post to show others how easy is to be vegan in Berlin and Munich (the Berlin info is in a previous post) and to suggest some really great vegan restaurants!

I have personally visited each place described below and taken all the pictures myself.  The map at the end contains additional restaurants that I did not go to but read about as having vegan options.

### Beer
The Reinheitsgebot, or “German Beer Purity Law”, is a Bavarian law from 1516 that states the only ingredients that could be used in the production of beer were water, barley, and hops.  Since 1516, there is a revised law (“Provisional Beer Law”) of 1993, which states that only water, malted barley, hops and yeast can be used for any bottom-fermented beer brewed in Germany.  This is good news for vegans, because it means German beers are vegan.

### Allergens
All the menus have letters or numbers with a legend indicating possible allergens.  These include egg and dairy but also soy, wheat, nuts, seafood, etc.

## Shopping (Makeup)

**Müller** - (€€) Sonnenstraße 2, 80331.  Department store that sells vegan makeup (Lavera, Terra Naturi).  It was so cool!  Even the makeup displays had symbols on the vegan products indicating they are vegan.
