I am currently in Agadir, Morocco for 5 weeks in October and November.
While I am here, I am visiting multiple cities including Marrakech, Essaouira, Casablanca, and Rabat.

I have personally visited each place described below.  The pictures were taken either by me or my friend.  All the food shown below is vegan.

My local host told me that most foods in bakeries and restaurants are made with "natural butter" (in other words, vegetable margarine) because it is less expensive than butter made from animals.  This may be true, but it was too complicated for me to try to ask so I just avoided all kinds of butter in general.

## Agadir

### Section??


## Marrakech
### Jemaa el-Fna
**Earth Cafe** - Vegetarian with vegan options, 2, Derb Zawak, Riad Zitoun Kedim, Medina.
This restaurant is down one of the narrow alleys in the Jemaa el-Fna.  The easiest way to find this restaurant is to use Google Maps.  After you make your way to the main alley you will see signs above you leading you to Earth Cafe.  The menu is in English and has a vegetarian section and a vegan section.  There is a lot of cozy seating inside and it's a great place to have a respite away from the bustle of the market.

**Zeitoun Cafe** - Serves meat but has vegan options, 107 de la Place Jemaa el-Fna, Medina.
We came here by invitation from our contact at the US embassy so I was not expecting this restaurant to have vegan options.  Surprisingly, they had multiple vegan options and the menu (which was in French and English) clearly labeled items that were vegan!  Their menu is also on their website.  Our table shared the vegan Moroccan salads and I had the vegetable couscous.  They also had vegetable tagine.  This restaurant is in the center of the busy market and has a nice view if you sit upstairs outside.  It did seem like every table had tourists or foreigners.  But the food was great and was expensive by Moroccan standards, but not too expensive.
