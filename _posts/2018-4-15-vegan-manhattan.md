I recently returned from a 6-day trip to Manhattan.

I have personally visited each place described below and taken all the pictures myself.  All the food shown below is vegan.  The map at the end contains additional restaurants that I did not go to but read about as having vegan options.

## Restaurants

### Upper West Side
**Blossom du Jour** - ($$) Vegan, 449 Amsterdam Ave.  Transit: 1/2 to 79th St. or A/B/C to 81st St. Museum of Natural History.  
They have good, quick food and a community bulletin board.  There was also a PETA magazine on the counter seating.  I really enjoyed their un-chicken (which is a mixture of soy and wheat).  There are four Blossom du Jours in Manhattan (the others are in Midtown West, Hell's Kitchen, and Chelsea).
