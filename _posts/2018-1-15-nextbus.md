If you go to www.nextbus.com on your phone, you may notice that the homepage says "Sorry, but cannot show you predictions based on location because you did not allow the application to use your location."

            title="Error Message"
            caption="" %}

When I looked at my Google Chrome settings, I didn't see any indication that I had prevented NextBus from using my GPS location.  After a quick Google search, I found a StackExchange [post](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/144580/some-location-based-mobile-sites-not-working-in-chrome) where I learned that "only sites using https can request location information."

So, going to https://www.nextbus.com solves the issue, and allows NextBus to show you transit information based on your location.
